# Tomorrow

üìÜ Simple Swift Tool for convenience Date usage in your project.


## Features

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Parsing ISO8601 String to Date
- Auto handling formats with and without milliseconds
- Use ISO8601DateFormatter in new systems (iOS 11.0+, macOS 10.13+, tvOS 11.0+, watchOS 4.0+)

## Example

```swift
   
// "2020-11-01T21:10:56Z"
// "2020-11-01T21:10:56.715+01:00"
// "2020-11-01T21:10:56.22+02:00"

let date = Date.fromISO("2020-11-01T21:10:56.22+02:00")
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Tomorrow is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'Tomorrow'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate Tomorrow into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "lukszar/Tomorrow"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Tomorrow.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/lukszar/Tomorrow.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `Tomorrow`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Tomorrow into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Further development

This simple tool was created to check [SwiftKit](https://github.com/SvenTiigi/SwiftKit) in action.
I plan to extend this tool with new features soon. Stay tuned!
